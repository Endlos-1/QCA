    <p align="left" style="color:black"> <b>Why does the broker review and sign the advance agreement?</b><BR>
      Agents cannot advance commissions without the broker's consent. All commissions earned by your<br>agents belong to
      your company. The agreement you sign authorizes the sale and
      assignment of<br>the agent's portion of the commission on the subject sale to Quick Commission Advance, after any
      split or<br> balance owing to your company.
    </p>

    <p align="left" style="color:black"> <b>How does this helps my agents?</b><BR>
      We help agents manage their cash flow to manage their professional expenses effectively and meet<br>persoanl
      obligations. A commission advance alleviated financial distractions
      allowing the agent to focus<br>on pursuing prospects or closing their next deal. Consider Quick Commission Advance as
      a partner<br>you can count on to help your agents manage they when
      they get paid , keeping them motivated and<br>engaged. The result is more listings, more sales and increased
      productivity.
    </p>

    <p align="left" style="color:black"> <b>Is there liability for the broker?</b><BR>
      No, your broker does not bear any risk with a commission advance. You are solely responsible for the<br>repayment of
      the commission advance. If the transaction falls through, you are
      responsible<br>for directing any future earned commissions by agent to Quick Commission Advance. If the agent never<br>
      earns another commission or leaves your company, as the broker, you do not owe us anything,<br>we assume the risk and take loss. 
    </p>

    <p align="left" style="color:black"> <b>Are Broker Agents eligible for a commission advance?</b><BR>
      Yes, Quick Commission Advance will provide an advance to brokers acting as agents representing buyers <br>or sellers on their own sales. Rates differ from agent rates.<br>
     </p>

     <p align="left" style="color:black"> <b>What is the benifit for thr broker?</b><BR>
      By quickly securing working capital, your agents can pay bills and capitalize on business opportuinities.<br>As the broker, you don't have to worry about being a source of funding 
      to float your agents to the next<br>closing. Instead of overcomplicating your relationship with agents, you can keep them focused on<br>managing their business and capitalizing on opportuinities.
      The broker has the final say; commissions<br>are only advanced upon your authorization. Keep in mind the advance is only on the agent's net earnings,<br>after the broker split, after the broker split,
      so your portion is not effected. New agents may find it appealing to participate in<br>our service to even out their cash flow reducing recruiting and retention costs for your business.
      And<br>the cost of the advance may be tax deductable making even more affordable for your agents.<br><br>
