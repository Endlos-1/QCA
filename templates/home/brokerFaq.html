    <p align="left" style="color:black"> <b>Why does the broker review and sign the advance agreement?</b><BR>
      Agents cannot advance commissions without the broker's consent. All commissions earned by your agents belong to
      your company. The agreement you sign authorizes the sale and
      assignment of the agent's portion of the commission on the subject sale to Quick Commission Advance, after any
      split or balance owing to your company.
    </p>

    <p align="left" style="color:black"> <b>How does this helps my agent?</b><BR>
      We help agents manage their cash flow to manage their professional expenses effectively and meet persoanl
      obligations. A commission advance alleviated financial distractions
      allowing the agent to focus on pursuing prospects or closing their next deal. Consider Quick Commission Advance as
      a partner you can count on to help your agents manage they when
      they get paid , keeping them motivated and engaged. The result is more listings, more sales and increased
      productivity.
    </p>

    <p align="left" style="color:black"> <b>Is there liability for the broker?</b><BR>
      No, your broker does not bear any risk with a commission advance. You are solely responsible for the repayment of
      the commission advance. If the transaction falls through, you are
      responsible for replacing it with future earned commissions. The Broker is responsible for directing any future
      earned commissions by the agent to Quick Commission Advance.
    </p>

    <p align="left" style="color:black"> <b>Are Broker Agents eligible for a commission advance?</b><BR>
      Yes, Quick Commission Advance will provide an advance to brokers acting as agents representing buyers or sellers on their own sales. Rates differ from agent rates.<br>
     </p>

     <p align="left" style="color:black"> <b>What is the benifit for thr broker?</b><BR>
      By quickly securing working capital, your agents can pay bills and capitalize on business opportuinities. As the broker, you don't have to worry about being a source of funding 
      to float your agents to the next closing. Instead of overcomplicating your relationship with agents, you can keep them focused on managing their business and capitalizing on opportuinities.
      The broker has the final say; commissions are only advanced upon your authorization. Keep in mind the advance is only on the agent's net earnings, after the broker split, after the broker split,
      so your portion is not effected. New agents may find it appealing to participate in our service to even out their cash flow reducing recruiting and retention costs for your business.
      And the cost of the advance may be tax deductable making even more affordable for your agents.<br><br>
